Hi, my name is Chase, and I'm a Ruby on Rails developer. I ship code at [Printed Mint](https://printedmint.com).

I also tinker with Python (a similar language with a rich data science and machine learning ecosystem) and Golang (it's good at concurrency which Ruby is notoriously bad at).

Before I became a developer, I worked on the business side of startups, and before that, I got a degree in history and served up coffee.

If you want to drop me a line, you can reach me at <chasestevenspersonal@gmail.com>.
