My father enrolled at ASU as a computer science major. Back home in Erie, he had developed a security program called "Hamburger Lock", and with his entrepreneurial spirit, he sold his program around town.

After a semester, though, he switched majors to construction. When asked why, he said "I was good, but everyone around me was at another level. They were destined for this -- I didn't fit in."

Looking back at both my dad's intelligence level (I have to admit -- he's as smart as a tack) and my personal experience interaction with programmers, I can say that he was just as smart as anyone else in that room. It wasn't that he couldn't handle the material. He was intimidated and changed courses.

Software developers are 80% white and 95% men [ed note -- check for real numbers]. Founders get funding for ideas that are basically just busses. The "Move Fast and Break Things" ethos no longer applies to technology. Tech's days as the gold standard for work is past. Now, software companies are viewed with the same level of skepticism as financing firms. They'll do anything to get a buck.

We write off technically skilled yet socially deficit programmers as "awkward" and look the other way while they write software that generates revenue (or automates jobs) for their company.

Harvard Business Review said that soft skills, not software skills, are the number one most valuable skillset to have in today's corporate climate.

People view software as cold, rational logic that underpins every interaction of society, but the truth is that software is written by people, used by people, and designed by people every step of the process. Every decision made about computers, from the code running your operating system to the HTML and CSS in your browser rendering this content.

By your very nature as a human being, nothing about coding or technology is beyond you.

Maybe I'm crazy. Maybe this is like saying that I could pick up any book in any language in the world and immediately comprehend it simply because it was written by a human. This is not the case. Aside from the language barrier, the book could be ancient and I would be unaware of the social and cultural context it was written in.

There is certainly a skill in comprehension -- of code, language, or culture. But something in that line of code, or in that language, or in that book, does speak to you, and by cutting through the confusion, it could speak to you.
