We all get stuck in programming. The difference between a novice and a master is how they overcome a roadblock.

## Be specific
The more relevant details you provide, the easier someone else will be able to help you.

## Demonstrate what you've tried already
No one wants to do work for you. By showing what you've tried, you've demonstrated that you've put in legitimate effort and are stuck. Simply asking how to do something looks like a teenager asking someone else to do their homework for them.
